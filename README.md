# file_generator-in-go


i have been learning go for 2 days now and i was practising the file system in go which is similar to c so i thought why not make the script for making a new file so i could make the  script in go 

this is not same as linux touch command 


this is purely written in go which is only a .txt file generator so enjoy 


you can use this on any os just do 

go build main.go

you are good to go
